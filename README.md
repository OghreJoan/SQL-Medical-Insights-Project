# SQL-Medical-Insights-Project
SQL Data Analysis Project

INTRODUCTION

This project showcases an SQL-based data analysis conducted to extract insights from a structured dataset. The objective was to perform data cleaning, aggregation, and query optimization to generate meaningful results for business decision-making.

**Project Overview**

Project Name: Medical Insights

Tools Used: **MySQL** for cleaning and transformation, **Power BI** for Visualization.

Data Source: Kaggle

Key Focus Areas: Data cleaning, querying, aggregation, and reporting

**Data Cleaning Process**

Handling Missing Values:

Used IS NULL and COALESCE() to detect and replace missing values.

Removing Duplicates:

Utilized DISTINCT to remove redundant data entries.

Data Type Standardization:

Ensured column data types were appropriate (e.g., dates in DATE format, numerical values in INT/FLOAT).

Normalization:

Structured data into separate tables to reduce redundancy using JOIN operations.

Data Validation:

Used constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK) to enforce data integrity.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

The dashboard tracks the following KPIs:

Total Medical Expenses: $379.8M
Total Patients: 497K
Total Medical Cases Analyzed: 901

**Insights and Findings**

Identified the most frequently occurring medical conditions in different hospitals.

Analyzed the distribution of medical expenses among patients.

Established relationships between doctors and hospitals.

Determined the average duration of patient stays in different hospitals.

**RECOMMENDATION**

**Data Integrity**: Hospitals should enforce constraints to maintain consistency.

**Efficient Storage**: Data normalization should be implemented to improve query performance.

**Advanced Reporting**: Integrate Power BI for more in-depth visual analytics.

**Optimize medication procurement strategies to reduce high costs.**

**Explore alternative treatment methods to lower expenses.​**

**Reduce hospital stay through better outpatient management.​**

**Forecast seasonal trends in admissions to optimize budget allocation.​**

**Conclusion**

This SQL project demonstrates how structured query language (SQL) can be used to clean, process, and extract valuable insights from hospital data. The findings provide actionable recommendations to improve hospital data management and reporting systems. This project serves as a strong portfolio piece showcasing database querying and data analysis skills.
